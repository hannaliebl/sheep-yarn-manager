Toy project to learn how to use sequelize. Manage theoretical sheep and yarn made from them. Inspired by [my sister](https://www.etsy.com/shop/WindfallFiber).

TODO:

- [ ] Figure out associations:
  - [ ] Sheep hasMany Yarn
  - [ ] Sheep hasMany Sheep (relatives)
  - [ ] Yarn is also possibly made from many sheep, but definitely at least one
- [ ] Add in React
- [ ] Allow basic POSTing of sheep and yarn
- [ ] Then also display all sheep and all yarn
- [ ] Then deal with editing and deleting yarn and sheep
- [ ] Actually learn how to do migrations
- [ ] Deployment?
